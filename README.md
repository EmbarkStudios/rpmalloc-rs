WIP implementation of [rpmalloc](https://github.com/rampantpixels/rpmalloc) as a Rust global memory allocator.

See the [rpmalloc README](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc/blob/master/README.md) for a detailed description of how the allocator works, peforms, and compares with other allocators.

## How to use

To use rpmalloc as the global allocator in your Rust binary crate, in `Cargo.toml` add:

```toml
[dependencies]
rpmalloc = "0.1.0"
```

And then in one of your `.rs` files:

```rust
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: rpmalloc::RpMalloc = rpmalloc::RpMalloc;
```

### Configuration

It is also possible to configure how the allocator should be built through a set of feature flags that correspond to the rpmalloc C library `ENABLE_x` defines:

- Overall: `statistics`, `validate_args`, `asserts`, `guards`
- Cache: `unlimited_cache`, `unlimited_global_cache`, `unlimited_thread_cache`, `global_cache`, `thread_cache`, `adaptive_thread_cache`

Example usage:

```toml
[dependencies]
rpmalloc = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["guards", "statistics"] }
```

See [rpmalloc README](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc/blob/master/README.md) for detailed descriptions of the config options.

Note that all of these have not been tested together with this Rust crate.

## Support

This crate has been tested to support the following platforms and Rust targets:

- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

PRs to increase the amount of supported targets are welcome, but they should add CI verification and avoid adding additional dependencies.
