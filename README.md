WIP implementation of [rpmalloc](https://github.com/rampantpixels/rpmalloc) as a Rust global memory allocator.

See the [rpmalloc README](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc/blob/master/README.md) for a detailed description of how the allocator works, peforms, and compares with other allocators.

## How to use

To use rpmalloc as the global allocator in your Rust binary crate, in `Cargo.toml` add:

```toml
[dependencies]
rpmalloc = "0.1.0"
```

And then in one of your `.rs` files:

```rust
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: rpmalloc::RpMalloc = rpmalloc::RpMalloc;
```
